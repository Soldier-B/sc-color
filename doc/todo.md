## Build / Project Related

* Add nicely formatted HTML document
    * A color library should have docs with a bit more color
    * Build from markdown + results of evaluated code
    * Keep it simple: the old docs were nice, but too much trouble to maintain
* Generate browser version of the library
    * Use webpack or browserify
    * Minify with correct versioning
* Switch to mocha / chai as the unit testing library

## Features

* Allow color() to parse / hold color sets (similar to jQuery selection sets)
