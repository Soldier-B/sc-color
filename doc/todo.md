# TODO

* Add proper HTML documentation built from MD + evaluated code: the docs for a color library should have some color...
* Add a proper build step to generate the browser version of the library (with the version number copied from package.json, not hard-coded)
* Allow color() to parse / hold color sets (similar to jQuery selection sets)
* Switch to mocha / chai as the unit testing library
